  <h1>Mayday Band Rotating Animation</h1>
  <p>
    In my project, I utilized a rotating animation created with p5.js to demonstrate the dynamic rotation of the cartoon avatars of the members of the band MAYDAY.
    This project is a character animation demo based on a sine wave rotation effect and contains five characters: Ashin, Masa, Monster, Ming, and Stone.
    Each character has a unique look and feel with different colors and images. The rotational motion, driven by sine waves, achieves a rhythmic oscillation effect similar to that of a live concert.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each member uses separate <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> blocks to control their rotation and position. The code applies the rotation with <code>rotate(sin(angle) * 0.5)</code> to give them a dancing animation effect.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation of each part:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Global variable angle:</strong> Controls the angle of rotation, which changes slightly randomly as <code>angle += 0.1 + random(-0.05, 0.05)</code> in the <code>draw()</code> function, giving the rotation a natural wiggly effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Sine wave function <code>sin(angle)</code>:</strong> Achieves a smooth rotation effect, where the rotation angle constantly changes between -0.5 and 0.5, creating a dynamic visual effect of rocking.</li>
    <li><strong>Randomization <code>random(-0.05, 0.05)</code>:</strong> Makes the character rotate slightly irregularly, adding to the vividness of the animation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Interestingly, in addition to using <code>rotate(sin(angle) * 0.5);</code> for rotation, you can also use <code>rotate(angle % TWO_PI)</code>. This produces a continuous smooth rotation, rather than a swing. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe the sine wave rotation effect is more appropriate for the "Live Nation" theme of this project.
